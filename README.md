## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and Express

By utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and Express I was able to create a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. Simply answer the questions provided and a random name will be generated for you.

## Optimizations

I am still working out some kinks in this app. The questions included in the survey hold no values, so it does'nt make a difference which answers you choose as to the name you will be given.

## Lessons Learned:

Relying on back-end frameworks such as Node.js and Express to make an app functional was new to me.

## Installation

1. Clone repo

## Usage

1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8000`
